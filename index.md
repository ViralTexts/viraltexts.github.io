This site presents <a href="http://clusters.viraltexts.org" target="_blank">data</a>, <a href="http://networks.viraltexts.org/1836to1899/index.html" target="_blank">visualizations</a>, <a href="http://loveletter.viraltexts.org/neatline/fullscreen/exhibit" target="_blank">interactive exhibits</a>, and both [computational and literary publications](/publications/) drawn from the _Viral Texts_ project, which seeks to develop theoretical models that will help scholars better understand what qualities—both textual and thematic—helped particular news stories, short fiction, and poetry “go viral” in nineteenth-century newspapers and magazines. During this period, texts published in newspapers and magazines were not typically protected as intellectual property, and so literary texts as well as other non-fiction prose texts circulated promiscuously among newspapers as editors freely reprinted materials borrowed from other venues. In the _Viral Texts_ project, we ask: What texts were reprinted and why? How did ideas—literary, political, scientific, economic, religious—circulate in the public sphere and achieve critical force among audiences? By employing and developing computational linguistics tools to analyze the large textual databases of nineteenth-century newspapers newly available to scholars, this project will generate new knowledge of the nineteenth-century print public sphere.

### Project History

In its first phase (2012-2014), Viral Texts focused on developing its text reuse discovery algorithms and investigating reprinting in the nineteenth-century United States. Links to publications from this phase can be found on our publications page. In 2015-2016, the Viral Texts team focused on improving the project's algorithms and investigating international reprinting among English-language newspapers in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, which led to use joining a larger group of newspaper scholars in the [_Oceanic Exchanges_ project](https://oceanicexchanges.org/) between 2017-2020. Currently, the _Viral Texts_ team is collaborating with scholars from Washington University's [Racial Violence Archive](https://www.racialviolencearchive.com) on a Mellon-funded study of [The Virality of Racial Terror, 1863-1921](https://viraltexts.org/2023/01/24/vrt/).

Viral Texts is sponsored by Northeastern University's <a href="http://nulab.neu.edu/" target="_blank">NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks</a> and generously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities' <a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh" target="_blank">Office of Digital Humanities</a> and the American Council of Learned Societies' <a href="https://www.acls.org/research/digital.aspx?id=798&amp;linkidentifier=id&amp;itemid=798" target="_blank">Digital Innovation Fellowship</a> Program. The project team includes Professors <a href="http://ryancordell.org" target="_blank">Ryan Cordell</a> (Associate Professor of Information Sciences and English, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) and <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dasmith/" target="_blank">David Smith</a> (Associate Professor of Computer Science, Northeastern University), alongside [colleagues past and present](/team/).

*Our website cover image is "The Country Editor–Paying the Yearly Subscription" by F.S. Church, from* Harper's Weekly *(17 January 1874). In it a rural man seeks to pay for his local newspaper subscription with a pair of chickens. The editor weighs this proposal amidst the fruit of similar negotiations all around. Most pertinent to this project, however, are the scissors and newspaper clippings on the editor's desk, and the pasted-up clipping from which the compositor (the man through the door on the left) is setting type. These clues point to the importance of the exchange system, and the reprinting we are tracking in Viral Texts, in creating the nineteenth-century American newspaper.*
