### Book Project 

+ We are currently working on a hybrid digital-print book project, [*Going the Rounds: Virality in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers*](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/going-the-rounds) through the University of Minnesota's Manifold Scholarship Initiative. Two draft chapters are currently published online: David A. Smith and Ryan Cordell, ["Textual Criticism as Language Modeling"](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/untitled-883630b9-c054-44e1-91db-d053a7106ecb) and Jonathan D. Fitzgerald and Ryan Cordell, ["Classifying Vignettes, Modeling Hybridity"](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/untitled-bd3eb0af-fdad-4dd6-9c94-3fd15d522ab6).

### Online Exhibits and Visualizations
